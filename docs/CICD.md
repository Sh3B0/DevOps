The process and practices for both applications is similar: setting up an automated process so that code that gets pushed to the remote repository by the developers gets automatically **tested, built and deployed**.

A *workflow* (described in a YAML file) defines actions that are triggered by some events (e.g., push to the remote repo), after which some jobs (each described by a sequence of steps) are run on GitHub servers in parallel (jobs can be set up to depend on each other with the `needs` key).
